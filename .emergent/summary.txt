The AI engineer successfully transitioned a Loyalty Control-Tower application from an MVP to a more refined and feature-rich product. The initial phase focused on dark mode implementation, progressing from basic state management to intricate styling adjustments based on iterative user feedback, addressing color tones, button styles, and icon choices. Subsequently, the engineer implemented branding changes for lech.world, including an elegant card design and subtle background textures. A significant portion of the work involved enhancing member management, introducing dynamic field editing, and enabling the creation and deletion of custom fields. Finally, a comprehensive WhatsApp export feature was developed, allowing users to share detailed member data, including sensitive information. The engineer also addressed several UI/UX bugs, such as mobile button overflow and WhatsApp button visibility, demonstrating robust debugging and responsiveness to user-reported issues.

<product_requirements>
The application, Loyalty Control-Tower, is a single-page web app for an admin user to monitor points balances for up to 4 named members across LATAM Pass, GOL Smiles, and Azul TudoAzul. Initially planned for API integration, it shifted to manual data entry with fields for last-sync date/time, editable member credentials (login, loyalty-card ID, PIN), and points balance. The UI is a polished, minimalist dashboard (light grey, white details, marine blue accents) with person-centric cards, expandable program blocks, and inline editing. Authentication uses / (later /), case-insensitive. It features full Portuguese-BR localization, copy-to-clipboard, a global Histórico de Atualizações log, and Post-it note widgets. Recent updates include integrating a João Lech quote, moving Total de Pontos to the top bar, and repositioning Histórico and Sair buttons. The application has implemented dark mode, dynamic field management for loyalty programs, and a WhatsApp export feature.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently engaged in addressing several user-reported UI/UX issues. The primary focus was on rectifying the behavior and appearance of the WhatsApp export button and the member program edit buttons.

Specifically, the engineer was working on:
1.  **WhatsApp Button on Mobile**: The user reported that the mobile WhatsApp banner (designed to appear on scroll) was not consistently visible. The engineer attempted to fix this by modifying visibility logic and CSS properties in  and , aiming for a fixed button always present at the bottom of the mobile screen as a fall-back (, ).
2.  **WhatsApp Component in Web View**: The user observed an unexpected WhatsApp component acting as a sidebar on the right in the web view. The engineer was attempting to identify and remove any such duplicate or misplaced elements in  and .
3.  **Mobile Button Layout**: The four program block buttons (Editar campos, Deletar programa, Cancelar, Salvar) were overlapping or not fitting correctly within the UI on mobile view. The engineer adjusted CSS (e.g., , ) to improve their layout.
4.  **Editar programa de pontos Button Overlap (Web View)**: The user noted that this button was still overlapping the first field in the web view. The engineer applied CSS adjustments (e.g., , ) to address this.

The trajectory ends with the AI engineer acknowledging the user's latest feedback on these issues and stating the intention to implement the fixed button at the base of the mobile screen option for the WhatsApp button.
