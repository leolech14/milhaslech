## The Problem

### Fragmented Loyalty Program Management

Families accumulate dozens of loyalty programs across airlines, hotels, and credit cards, but tracking becomes a nightmare. Information is scattered across emails, physical cards, and various apps, leading to missed opportunities and expired rewards.

**Our Solution:** Centralized dashboard with all programs in one place.

### Password and Access Chaos

Each program has different login credentials, security questions, and access requirements. Family members constantly forget passwords or can't access programs when needed.

**Our Solution:** Secure credential storage with easy family sharing.

### Missing Optimization Opportunities

Without visibility into all programs at once, families miss opportunities to pool points, transfer between programs, or achieve elite status through strategic spending.

**Our Solution:** Unified view enabling strategic decision-making.

## Differentiators

### Family-Centric Design

Unlike individual loyalty trackers, we provide multi-member management with role-based access. This allows families to manage programs collectively while maintaining individual privacy.

### Dark Mode First

Built with dark mode as the primary interface, reducing eye strain during late-night travel planning sessions. This results in better user experience and accessibility.

### Real-Time Synchronization

All family members see updates instantly without page refresh. This ensures everyone has the latest information when making travel decisions.
